# pitch-spelling-lisp

This repository contains lisp implementations of the pitch-spelling algorithms of Cambouropoulos and Longuet-Higgins, along with an early implementation of Meredith's ps13 algorithm. The implementations in this repository were used to produce the results reported in the following paper:
